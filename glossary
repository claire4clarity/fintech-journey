## FinTech Lexicon

### Acquiring Bank
A financial institution that maintains a merchant's bank account. They are the "muscle" behind the merchant, enabling them to accept credit and debit card payments by acting as a middleman between the merchant and the card networks (like Visa or Mastercard).

### Application Programming Interface (API)

A set of protocols that allows two software applications to communicate with each other.  In the FinTech context, they allow an Acquiring Bank to securely ask an Issuing Bank whether the customer/client has sufficient funds to send the payment.

### Application Programming Interface (API) Key

A unique identifier (a long string of random letters and numbers) used to authenticate a user, developer, or calling program to an API. It acts as both a Username and a Password rolled into one. When your code makes a request, it includes this key. The server checks its ledger; if the key matches, the gates open. In finance, API keys are often restricted. A key might have "Read-Only" permission (can see a balance) or "Write" permission (can move money)

### OAuth 2.0
OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard authorization framework, released in 2012. It allows third-party applications to access user data, such as Google, Facebook, or GitHub profiles, without exposing user passwords.

### Webhooks

An automated, event-driven message that pushes data from one application to another when a specific event occurs; enabling real-time data transfer without require continuous polling.  They are often called “reverse APIs”.  FinTech Use Case: When a customer makes a purchase on an e-commerce site, Stripe uses a Webhook to tell the merchant's website, "The payment was successful! You can now ship the item.

### Sandbox

The Regulatory Sandbox is controlled environment set up by regulators (like the CFPB or FCA) to allow companies to test innovative products with real customers under relaxed rules for a set period.

The Developer Sandbox is a mirror-image testing environment provided by an API company (like Stripe or Plaid). It uses "fake" money and data so developers can build and test their code without risking real financial loss.

*Note: While a 'Regulatory Sandbox' involves real customers and live money under legal supervision, a 'Developer Sandbox' is purely for testing code with mock data.*

### Stablecoin

A type of cryptocurrency whose value is "pegged" or tied to another asset, such as the U.S. Dollar, gold, or a basket of currencies, to maintain a steady price. Most cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) fluctuate wildly. If you buy a coffee for 0.0002 BTC today, that same amount might be worth a steak dinner tomorrow. Stablecoins allow for digital payments without the "price-swing" anxiety.
